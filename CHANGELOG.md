# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

First release. Persistent file-based memory system for Claude Code with composite scoring, lifecycle management, and feedback loops.

### Core

- **SessionStart hook** — single-pass awk parsing, composite scoring (keywords + TF-IDF + WAL spaced repetition), domain filtering, adaptive quotas, project detection via longest-prefix match
- **Stop hook** — lifecycle rotation with type-specific decay rates, auto-generated continuity from git state, background TF-IDF rebuild
- **Outcome tracking** (PostToolUse) — detects when injected mistake warnings fail to prevent repeats, feeds negative outcomes back into WAL scoring

### Memory types

- **mistakes** — bugs and anti-patterns with recurrence, severity, root-cause, prevention (3 global + 3 project quota)
- **strategies** — proven approaches with trigger and success count (cap 4)
- **feedback** — behavioral rules with why/how structure (cap 6)
- **knowledge** — domain facts, API docs, infrastructure (cap 4)
- **decisions** — architecture and technology choices with alternatives and reasoning (cap 3)
- **notes** — long-form knowledge, references, URLs (cap 2)
- **projects** — project descriptions and stack (1 per project, never archived)
- **continuity** — session handoff state (auto-generated from git)

### New in this release

- **Error pattern detection** — PostToolUse hook on Bash catches warnings and deprecation notices on successful commands via configurable `.error-patterns`, with session dedup and cross-reference to existing mistakes
- **Blocking fuzzy dedup** — PreToolUse hook blocks creation of duplicate mistakes using rapidfuzz trigram similarity (via `uv run`); similarity >= 80% blocks write, >= 50% warns
- **PreCompact checkpoint** — reminds Claude to save unsaved insights before context window compression; stronger warning if nothing was saved in session
- **Cold start domain fallback** — when git keyword signal is weak (< 3 keywords), project domains from `projects-domains.json` are used as pseudo-keywords for baseline scoring

### Testing

- 81 smoke tests covering injection, domain filtering, WAL, TF-IDF, outcome tracking, error detection, fuzzy dedup, decisions, precompact, cold start
- 15 benchmark scenarios for precision, domain filtering, priority ranking, edge cases
